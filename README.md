# Golden Ratio Port

Bootstrapped with [typescript-p5js-starter](https://github.com/mpace965/typescript-p5js-starter).

This is a port of my [Spirals](https://github.com/mpace965/processing-sketchbook/tree/master/Spirals) Processing sketch to p5.js.

The sketch is now responsive and looks good in fullscreen at any size.
